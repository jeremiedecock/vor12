============
Introduction
============

The VoR12_ project is a mobile video camera.
It uses two `Dynamixel AX-12`_ actuators and the OpenCV_ computer vision
library for object tracking experiments.

.. note::

    This project is still in *beta* stage, so the API is not finalized yet.


.. Features
.. --------
.. - lightweight
.. - TODO...

Dependencies
============

-  Python 3.4
-  `OpenCV`_ versions 3.0.0 or above
-  `PyAX-12`_
-  `NumPy`_

.. VoR12 is tested to work with Python 3.4 under Gnu/Linux Debian 8 and Windows
.. 7.
.. It should also work with Python 3.X under recent Gnu/Linux and Windows systems.
.. It hasn't been tested (yet) on MacOSX and BSD systems.
.. 
.. `Python-serial`_ is required to install VoR12.

.. note::

    If you use ``pip`` to install VoR12, PyAX-12 and Numpy will be
    automatically downloaded and installed (see the following install_
    section).

    OpenCV cannot be installed with ``pip``, thus you have to install it
    manually.

Installation
============

Gnu/Linux
---------

You can install, upgrade, uninstall VoR12 with these commands (in a
terminal)::

    pip install --pre vor12
    pip install --upgrade vor12
    pip uninstall vor12

Or, if you have downloaded the VoR12 source code::

    python3 setup.py install

.. There's also a package for Debian/Ubuntu::
.. 
..     sudo apt-get install vor12

Windows
-------

.. .. note::
.. 
..     The following installation procedure has been tested to work with Python
..     3.4 under Windows 7.
..     It should also work with recent Windows systems.

You can install, upgrade, uninstall VoR12 with these commands (in a
`command prompt`_)::

    py -m pip install --pre vor12
    py -m pip install --upgrade vor12
    py -m pip uninstall vor12

Or, if you have downloaded the VoR12 source code::

    py setup.py install

MacOSX
-------

.. .. note::
.. 
..     The following installation procedure has been tested to work with Python
..     3.4 under MacOSX 10.6 (*Snow Leopard*).
..     It should also work with recent MacOSX systems.

You can install, upgrade, uninstall VoR12 with these commands (in a
terminal)::

    pip install --pre vor12
    pip install --upgrade vor12
    pip uninstall vor12

Or, if you have downloaded the VoR12 source code::

    python3 setup.py install


.. Example usage
.. =============
.. 
.. .. Please check whether the serial port, the baudrate and the
.. .. Dynamixel IDs defined in the following examples fits with your hardware.
.. 
.. In the following examples, the ``dynamixel_id``, ``port`` and ``baudrate``
.. values should be adapted depending on your configuration:
.. 
.. - for **Linux** users:
..   
..   - the ``port`` value should be something like
..   
..     - "/dev/ttyS0", "/dev/ttyS1", ... if you use an actual serial port
..     - "/dev/ttyUSB0", "/dev/ttyUSB1", ... if you use an `USB to serial` adapter
..       (like the USB2Dynamixel_ adapter)
.. 
..   - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
..     Dynamixel units
.. 
.. - for **Windows** users:
.. 
..   - the ``port`` value should be something like "COM2", "COM3", ... (see the
..     *COM port* configuration in the Windows `device manager`_)
..   - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
..     the Dynamixel units *and* the Windows `device manager`_ (i.e. check the
..     *COM port* configuration in the Windows `device manager`_)
.. 
.. - for **MacOSX** users:
..   
..   - the ``port`` value should be something like "/dev/tty.usbserial-XXX" if you
..     use an `USB to serial` adapter like the USB2Dynamixel_ adapter
..   - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
..     Dynamixel units
.. 
.. If you use the USB2Dynamixel_ device, make sure its switch is set on "TTL".
.. 
.. Some other examples are available in the examples_ directory.
