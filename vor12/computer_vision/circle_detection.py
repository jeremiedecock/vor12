        "In HSV, it is easier to represent a color than RGB color-space. In our
        application, we will try to extract a blue colored object. So here is the
        method:

        1. Take each frame of the video
        2. Convert from BGR to HSV color-space
        3. We threshold the HSV image for a range of blue color
        4. Now extract the blue object alone, we can do whatever on that image we want."

    How to find HSV values to track?
    
    As said in https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_colorspaces/py_colorspaces.html:

        "This is a common question found in stackoverflow.com. It is very simple and
        you can use the same function, cv2.cvtColor(). Instead of passing an image,
        you just pass the BGR values you want. For example, to find the HSV value of
        Green, try following commands in Python terminal:
        
            >>> green = np.uint8([[[0,255,0 ]]])
            >>> hsv_green = cv2.cvtColor(green,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
            >>> print hsv_green
            [[[ 60 255 255]]]
        
        Now you take [H-10, 100,100] and [H+10, 255, 255] as lower bound and upper
        bound respectively. Apart from this method, you can use any image editing
        tools like GIMP or any online converters to find these values, but donâ€™t
        forget to adjust the HSV ranges."
