Description
===========

The VoR12 project is a mobile video camera.
It uses two `Dynamixel AX-12`_ actuators and the OpenCV_ computer vision
library for object tracking experiments.

Note:

    This project is still in beta stage, so the API is not finalized yet.

Dependencies
============

-  Python 3.4
-  `OpenCV`_ versions 3.0.0 or above
-  `PyAX-12`_
-  `NumPy`_

.. VoR12 is tested to work with Python 3.4 under Gnu/Linux Debian 8 and Windows
.. 7.
.. It should also work with Python 3.X under recent Gnu/Linux and Windows systems.
.. It hasn't been tested (yet) on MacOSX and BSD systems.
.. 
.. `Python-serial`_ is required to install VoR12.

Note:

    If you use ``pip`` to install VoR12, PyAX-12 and Numpy will be
    automatically downloaded and installed (see the following install_
    section).

    OpenCV cannot be installed with ``pip``, thus you have to install it
    manually.
